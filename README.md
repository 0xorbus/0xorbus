- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xorbus. I write, edit, and code.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3, blockchain, decentralization, self-sovereignty, and incentivizing positive change.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the applications of NFTs and semi-fungible tokens in carbon offsets and real-world assets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on self-sovereign identity projects, tokenized skill sets, and projects that fight climate change.
- 📫 Reach me on Github @0xorbus or on Twitter @evrythingblongs
